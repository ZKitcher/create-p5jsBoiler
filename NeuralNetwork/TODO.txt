✔️ Add random mutation rates to NEAT Genomes constructors
✔️ Toggle drawn best brain.
✔️ average out and smoothen gradients for randomised track generation. //reduce chances of spiked tracks on end of screen turns
✔️ add NEATPopulation function to mutate x attribute by x % throughout the populace. ie: pop.mutateThroughout('output', 'tanh', 30) // change 30% of the populations output functions to tanh
✔️ Drifting cars
- Drift multiplyers for more points for longer drifts.
✔️ Add track Types. (asphalt, dirt, snow).
✔️ Improve NEAT loop efficiencies.
✔️ Add Fast Forward function to speed up generations.
- 3rd output for car network for handbrake. (drop traction by x value)
- Adjusts turning angle to rotate off velocity.
- Add Neural network labels for drawn models.
✔️ Add lap time bonuses for speed mode.
